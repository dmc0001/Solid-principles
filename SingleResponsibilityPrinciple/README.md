 the more often you need to change it. If your class implements multiple responsibilities,
 they are no longer independent of each other.

- <b>Lower coupling : </b>  less functionality then few dependices.
- <b>Class easy to understand : </b> as long the class does only one thing you can understand it very easily and that achieve the 
- <b>Organized : </b> as long the class is smaller and has a name describing what to do it's easy to know everything about my project.

## Getting Started

Welcome to the VS Code Java world. Here is a guideline to help you get started to write Java code in Visual Studio Code.

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.

> If you want to customize the folder structure, open `.vscode/settings.json` and update the related settings there.

## Dependency Management


The `JAVA PROJECTS` view allows you to manage your dependencies. More details can be found [here](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-java-dependency#manage-dependencies).
