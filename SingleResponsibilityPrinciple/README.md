## Single-responsibility

   The responsibility of at least one class. The more responsibilities your class has,
 the more often you need to change it. If your class implements multiple responsibilities,
 they are no longer independent of each other.

- <b>Testing : </b>  as long as you have less functionality so few testing cases.
- <b>Lower coupling : </b>  less functionality then few dependices.
- <b>Class easy to understand : </b>  as long class do only one thing you can understand it very easly and that achive the clean code.
- <b>Organized : </b>  as long class is smaller and have name descripe what to do it's easy to know everything about my project.

  all of those achive divide and concur

 >A class should have one, and only one, reason to change.

## Getting Started

Welcome to the VS Code Java world. Here is a guideline to help you get started to write Java code in Visual Studio Code.

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.

> If you want to customize the folder structure, open `.vscode/settings.json` and update the related settings there.

## Dependency Management

The `JAVA PROJECTS` view allows you to manage your dependencies. More details can be found [here](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-java-dependency#manage-dependencies).
