# Solid-principles
In software engineering, SOLID is a mnemonic acronym for five design principles intended to make object-oriented designs more understandable, flexible, and maintainable. The principles are a subset of many principles promoted by American software engineer and instructor Robert C. Martin:

- The single-responsibility principle: "There should never be more than one reason for a class to change." In other words, every class should have only one responsibility.
- The openâ€“closed principle: "Software entities ... should be open for extension, but closed for modification."
- The Liskov substitution principle: "Functions that use pointers or references to base classes must be able to use objects of derived classes without knowing it." See also design by contract.
- The interface segregation principle: "Clients should not be forced to depend upon interfaces that they do not use."
- The dependency inversion principle: "Depend upon abstractions, [not] concretions."
