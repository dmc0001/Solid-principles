# Solid-principles

In software engineering, <b>SOLID</b> is a mnemonic acronym for five design principles intended to make object-oriented designs more understandable, flexible, and maintainable. The principles are a subset of many principles promoted by American software engineer and instructor <b>Robert C. Martin</b>:

- <b>The single-responsibility principle: </b>"There should never be more than one reason for a class to change." In other words, every class should have only one responsibility.
- <b>The openâ€“closed principle: </b>"Software entities ... should be open for extension, but closed for modification."
- <b>The Liskov substitution principle: </b>"Functions that use pointers or references to base classes must be able to use objects of derived classes without knowing it." See also design by contract.
- <b>The interface segregation principle: </b>"Clients should not be forced to depend upon interfaces that they do not use."
- <b>The dependency inversion principle: </b>"Depend upon abstractions, [not] concretions."
